This German horror film has to be one of the weirdest I have seen.<br /><br />I was not aware of any connection between child abuse and vampirism, but this is supposed based upon a true character.<br /><br />Our hero is deaf and mute as a result of repeated beatings at the hands of his father. he also has a doll fetish, but I cannot figure out where that came from. His co-workers find out and tease him terribly.<br /><br />During the day a mild-manner accountant, and at night he breaks into cemeteries and funeral homes and drinks the blood of dead girls. They are all attractive, of course, else we wouldn't care about the fact that he usually tears their clothing down to the waist. He graduates eventually to actually killing, and that is what gets him caught.<br /><br />Like I said, a very strange movie that is dark and very slow as Werner Pochath never talks and just spends his time drinking blood.
A funny thing happened to me while watching "Mosquito": on the one hand, the hero is a deaf-mute and the director is totally unable to make us understand why he does what he does (mutilating mannequins...er, excuse me, corpses) through his images. On the other hand, the English version at least is very badly dubbed. So I found myself wishing there had been both more AND less dialogue at the same time! This film is stupid (funny how this guy has access to every graveyard and mortuary in his town) and lurid (where would we be in a 70s exploitationer without our gratuitous lesbian scene?). Not to mention the "romantic" aspect (oh, how sweet!)...Miss it. (*)
esta película es totalmente divertida que te va a dejar escapar una risa
Absolutamente la vi  y la volvería  a ver
es un premisa simple , un trabajador que se vuelve loco tras una jornada estresante 
maravillosamente humana , cálida , bella y divertida 
con una historia de amor encumbrada en un contexto en el que las maquinas han hecho acto de presencia en nuestra vida e inclusive , están comenzando a apoderarse de ella
A laugh riot and helps prove once again the Chaplin is a legend
Another masterpiece by Chaplin, as usual. WIth intriguing social commentary, side-splitting humor, and tender performances from all involved, this is a MUST for anyone who enjoys comedy, and drama in equal measure.
Charlie Chaplin's riveting depiction of industrialized America is funny, smart and carries a poignant and timely social critique.
